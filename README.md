## Installation

Use the package manager pip to install flask and pymongo.
```
pip install flask
pip install pymongo 
```

## Run
Use '127.0.0.1' and port '8080'

Run main.py
```
python main.py
```

## Used
Language: Python

Framework: Flask

Database: MongoDB

## What can be improved
Adding JavaScript functionalities to make UI more interactive

Using pagination for displaying batch records

Including more features (i.e. sorting batch records by attributes)

Using a MySQL database (I am more familiar with MongoDB, which is why I used it here) 

## Note
I have written separate python code to ETL the values from example_batch_records.csv into MongoDB. That python code can be found in ETL_to_database.py. This file is not necessary for running the application, however I have included it in the zip folder in case you want to see the code.
